## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does warehouse striping last?

The lifespan depends on floor conditions, traffic levels, and paint type. In most industrial settings, professional striping lasts 1–3 years. High-traffic forklift areas may require periodic touch-ups to maintain visibility and safety.

### What type of paint or coating do you use?

We use industrial-grade, highly durable coatings formulated for warehouses, including epoxy, polyurethane, and fast-drying acrylics. These coatings are designed to resist abrasion, forklift traffic, chemicals, and daily wear.

### Do you offer both interior and exterior line striping?

Yes. In addition to warehouse floors, we also stripe loading docks, parking lots, truck lanes, staging areas, and industrial yards, providing consistent, safety-focused markings inside and out.

### Do I need to shut down my warehouse during striping?

Not always. Many projects can be completed in sections, so your operations remain active. We work with your schedule to reduce disruption, including overnight and weekend service options.
