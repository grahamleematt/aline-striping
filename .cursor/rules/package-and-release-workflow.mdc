# Package and Release Workflow

- Use `yarn` for package operations in this repo.
- Before upgrades, summarize expected impact and flag major-version migrations.
- Prefer latest stable packages unless project constraints require pinning.
- Do not create commits unless explicitly requested by the user.
- When asked to commit, use descriptive messages that explain intent and impact.
- Do not push unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Verify core checks for touched areas (build, lint, or tests) before final handoff when practical.
