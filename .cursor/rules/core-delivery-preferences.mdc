# Core Delivery Preferences

- Start with a short implementation plan for multi-file or risky changes.
- Surface edge cases before editing, then include mitigations in the plan.
- Preserve working behavior unless the user explicitly asks for behavioral changes.
- Prefer incremental, low-risk edits over broad rewrites.
- Validate user-visible behavior after edits (especially navigation, layout, and responsiveness).
- Verify mobile and desktop parity for any layout or navigation change.
- Call out assumptions when requirements are ambiguous, then resolve quickly.
